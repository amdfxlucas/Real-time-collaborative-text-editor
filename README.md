Cooperative text editing system that allows one or more users to modify the content of a document simultaneously.

## Last Release [v0.1.4a - Nightly 1205] - 2019/10/27 @ 02:30 - [Differences]
- Added a lot of button and functionality on the text editor

## EM - Note
- Tomorrow morning I can't meet you guys, but I will reach you in the afternoon. Since I can't coming in the first morning, I decide to work a little this night and I made this nightly update. Tomorrow RC will continue his work on the client. Please, don't kill me for not making a better button on the editor, but I will fix it and continue my work in the afternoon until night.
